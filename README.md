# Fusering
Design a Keyring, get your creation shipped to your door! This repo contains all the files needed to run an instance of the Fusering site, made in Astro, along with copies of the guide for if you want to run Fusering as a workshop

## What's Fusering?
Fusering is a proposal for a Hack Club YSWS, where you learn how to build a keyring design using Figma and Fusion, and we'll print out your design and send it to you, along with carabiners to hang your design from your bag, or pretty much anything else you could think of! If you're a club leader or hackathon organiser and have access to a 3D printer, we'll send you filament and a large bag of carabiners to run Fusering as a workshop.
